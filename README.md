# Speaking Page Plugin

> Custom post type and presentation tools for a page to promote your speaking gigs.

The main reason why I developed this plugin is because I needed something to talk about at [WordCamp Nijmegen 2017](https://2017.nijmegen.wordcamp.org/session/oop-plugin-development-basics/).

This plugin is currently active on my personal blog, and you can see the output on my [Speaking Page](https://www.alainschlesser.com/speaking/).
